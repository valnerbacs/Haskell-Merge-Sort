In the "Concepts in Programming Languages" course, I delved into the intricacies of Haskell, a purely functional language, diverging from the imperative paradigms of languages like C and Java. The primary challenge lay in grasping Haskell's functional nature, devoid of side effects such as variable or pointer updates. My project focused on implementing a sorting feature in Haskell, accompanied by a detailed analysis of the language's distinctive characteristics.
